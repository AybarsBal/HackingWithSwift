# Project 31 - Multibrowser

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/31/overview

## Topics
UIStackView, iPad Multitasking, UIGestureRecognizerDelegate, Size Classes

## [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/31/6/wrap-up):
1. If you want to try extending this project, the sensible place to start is in the URL entry: if users don't type "http://" before their web site addresses the app fails, which isn't very helpful.

2. Another smart place to improve the app is inside the setDefaultTitle() method: it just writes Multibrowser in the navigation bar while leaving a large white space in the center â€“ hardly intuitive, and it wouldn't be hard to add a placeholder label in there telling users what to do.
